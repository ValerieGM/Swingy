This time the focus will be on graphical user interfaces and related software design patterns. The interaction of computer software with humans, raises many problems and requires specific solutions. Object Oriented programming is a paradigm that suits well this kind of problems, but also needs to introduce new ideeas, like event-driven programming. You will have to implement a minimalistic text-based RPG game and apply the best practices suited for this problem. At the end of the project you will understand how to abstract the user interface or the view from other parts of the application.
